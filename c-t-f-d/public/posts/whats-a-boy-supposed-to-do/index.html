Lately I have been listening to the song &ldquo;Disarm&rdquo; by the Smashing Pumpkins a lot. I love the chrous.
In the first chorus the lines are -

I used to be a little boy
So old in my shoes
What I choose is my choice
What&rsquo;s a boy supposed to do?
There is a very slight difference in the second chorus, but the impact of the change is cutting really deep this morning."><title>Whats a Boy Supposed to Do?
