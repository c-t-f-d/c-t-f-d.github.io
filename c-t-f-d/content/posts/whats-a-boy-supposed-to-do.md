Lately I have been listening to the song "Disarm" by the Smashing Pumpkins *a lot*. I love the chrous.

In the first chorus the lines are - 

> I used to be a little boy
> 
> So old in my shoes
>
> What I choose is my ***choice***
>
> What's a boy supposed to do?

There is a very slight difference in the second chorus, but the impact of the change is cutting really deep this morning.

> I used to be a little boy
>
> So old in my shoes
>
> What I choose is my ***voice***
>
> What's a boy supposed to do?

Learning to advocate for youself requires that you are armed with the facts so that you can give a good account of yourself, and express yourself without letting emotions take over.

Nevertheless, you must be prepared to accept that sometimes people will still disagree. 

How you deal with the disagreement is the sticky bit.

But there are times you must back yourself and believe in your decisions.
