title: 'On Being an Emotionally Challenged Human'
---

It ain't fun! ^_^

Some previous meanderings have included "sometimes I bring the mess and sometimes I bring the message", & "what the fuck did that mean?!"

I cannot take direct credit for these, however I resonate with the sentiment very strongly.

And even the topic of this post, "on being an emotionally challenged human", was lifted from another person.

But they all tie together.

Because the full quote that inspired this topic is, "Sadly people who aren't very nice do not deserve emotionally challenged people like us."

And this is true. In amongst the chaos of people who struggle emotioanlly, there's typically a heart of gold; easy to break, easy to melt, scarce but not impossibly rare, and unbelievably beautiful.
