One of the kindest things you can do for yourself is to talk to yourself about yourself as if you are your own best friend. 

When my sponsor suggested that I do this, and I actually listened to that advice and put it into practice, it caused a great schism in me. 

Because I then had to stop obeying the internal critic, who relentlessly pushed the lie that I am not "Good Enough".

But I am Good Enough.

And Enough is Enough.
