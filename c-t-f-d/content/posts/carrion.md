There's a saying that goes like this:

> how can you fly like an eagle when you're surrounded by turkeys?

I like this saying, and use it a lot. Recently however I have felt that something is missing from it. 

The consequences of not being supported by people around you leads to behaviour based on fear/anger/self pity, and that can lead to codependent behaviour. 

So I'm trying this one out for a while, see if it resonates:

> How can you hunt like an eagle when you're surrounded by turkey vultures.

In order to heal from childhood trauma, one of the steps is to recognise that some of us were denied the opportunity to have been brought up with the necessary support and love that everyone deserves, and have been forced to learn coping/defence mechanisms to support us "getting through".

The next step of healing is to recognise that whatever behaviours we learnt as a child are now holding us back; we are no longer the neglected child. We are the traumatised adult, who has survived. 

So we must thank our younger self for creating tools that helped us get to wehre we are now, but acknowledge that they are no longer required, and let them go.

Only then can we continue to heal.
